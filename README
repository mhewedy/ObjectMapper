ObjectMapper is a library created to make it easy to map NSDictionary and NSArray types (usually returned from parsing json data) into Custom user objects (Employee, Course, Window, etc).

The usage of the library is easy, please see ObjectMapperTester https://github.com/MuhammadHewedy/ObjectMapper/tree/master/ObjectMapperTester for sample usage.

// TODO add more documentation about the library
